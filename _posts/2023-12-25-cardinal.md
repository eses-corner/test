    “Awaking in New York” by Maya Angelou <br>
    Curtains forcing their will <br>
    against the wind, <br>
    children sleep,<br>
    exchanging dreams with<br>
    seraphim. The city<br>
    drags itself awake on<br>
    subway straps; and<br>
    I, an alarm, awake as a<br>
    rumor of war,<br>
    lie stretching into dawn,<br>
    unasked and unheeded.
